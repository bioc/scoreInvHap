Description: SNPfier can get the samples' inversion status of known inversions. SNPfier uses SNP data as
 input and requires the following information about the inversion: genotype frequencies in the different
 inversion groups, R2 between the region SNPs and inversion status, heterozygote genotypes in the
 reference and a LDA model. The package include this data for two well known inversions (8p23 and 17q21.31) and for four additional regions.
