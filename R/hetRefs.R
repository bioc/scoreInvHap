#' Heterozygote genotypes in the references
#'
#' Dataset with the heterozygote genotypes of all the SNPs used in any of the references. This dataset
#' include all the SNPs that are present inside the inversion's region in 1000 Genomes Phase 3.
#'
#' @format List of character vectors with the heterozygous genotypes of the SNPs present included
#' the region of four inversions (inv8p23.1, inv17q21.31, inv7p11.2 and invXq13.2).
#' Each element is named with the SNPs names.
