#' LDA models for inversion classification
#'
#' This dataset contains the LDA models needed to get the inversion status. LDA models have been computed
#' using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data. Real inversion status have been estimated using this data and
#' invClust. Test scores have been obtained from the same dataset.
