#' Genotype frequency in references
#'
#' Dataset with the genotype frequencies in the different haplotype populations.
#' These frequencies have been computed using the European samples of 1000 Genomes
#' Phase 3 data. Real inversion status have been estimated using invClust.
#'
#' @format List of matrices for four inversions (ROIno.8.3, ROIno.17.16, HsInv0286 and
#' HsInv0396). Each matrices has the frequency of each genotype in each haplotype.
