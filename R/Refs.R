#' Genotype frequency in references
#'
#' Dataset with the genotype frequencies in the different haplotype populations.
#' These frequencies have been computed using the European samples of 1000 Genomes
#' Phase 3 data. Real inversion status have been obtained from invFEST and 1000Genomes.
#'
#' @format List of matrices for 20 inversions. Each matrix has the frequency of
#' each genotype in each haplotype.
