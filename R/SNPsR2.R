#' R2 between the SNPs and the inversion status
#'
#' Dataset with R2 between the SNPs and the inversion status. This values are used to weigth
#' similarity scores. These values have been computed using the European samples
#' of 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data. Real inversion status have been estimated using
#' invClust.
#'
#' @format List of numeric vectors for 6 inversions (inv8p23.1, inv17q21.31, inv7p11.2
#' and invXq13.2).
