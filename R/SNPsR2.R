#' R2 between the SNPs and the inversion status
#'
#' Dataset with R2 between the SNPs and the inversion status. This values are used to weigth
#' similarity scores. These values have been computed using the European samples
#' of 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data. Real inversion status have been estimated using
#' invClust.
